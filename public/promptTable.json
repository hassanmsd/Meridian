    "prompt": "Summarize key crypto regulations in the EU",
    "response": "The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework establishes uniform licensing for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) across member states. It caps large euro-denominated stablecoins at €200 million of daily transactions unless backed by European-approved liquid reserves. MiCA also enforces stringent consumer-disclosure rules, travel-rule compliance for transfers above €1,000, and operational resilience standards akin to traditional financial institutions. These measures aim to reduce regulatory fragmentation while safeguarding users and financial stability.",

    "prompt": "Best hiking trails near Tokyo",
    "response": "Mount Takao offers well-maintained paths, sweeping views of Mount Fuji on clear days, and an easy train link from Shinjuku. Mount Mitake, reachable via the JR Ōme line and a short cable-car ride, features the ancient Musashi-Mitake shrine and lush cedar forests. Farther west, the Okutama region provides more rugged options such as the Lake Okutama loop and the climb to Mount Kumotori, Tokyo’s highest peak. All trails are serviced by lockers, kiosks, and onsen spots perfect for post-hike recovery.",

Regional neobanks like Nubank and Ualá continue to onboard millions of unbanked consumers with low-fee digital accounts. Several central banks, led by Brazil and Colombia, are piloting CBDCs for wholesale settlement. Cross-border stablecoin corridors are emerging, using USDC and local stablecoins to bypass FX frictions and reduce remittance costs by up to 60 percent.",

  {
    "prompt": "Explain the CRDT data-type",
    "response": "Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that allow concurrent, distributed updates without requiring coordination. Each replica can be modified independently, and thanks to mathematically defined merge functions, all replicas converge to the same state once updates are exchanged. CRDTs come in two flavors: operation-based (sending intents) and state-based (sending entire state). They are widely used in collaborative editors, offline-first mobile apps, and edge-deployed databases where low-latency local writes are critical.",

  {
    "prompt": "What is zero-knowledge proof?",
    "response": "A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol enabling one party (the prover) to convince another (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any underlying information. ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs are practical constructions that power privacy-preserving blockchains, rollups, and digital ID schemes. Typical use-cases include proving account balances, compliant KYC status, or execution of smart-contract logic while keeping data confidential, thereby enhancing privacy and scalability simultaneously.",
